# codingStuff
Just for Learning.
Files of stuff learned in different languages. Something to be able to copy and paste when developing or as a way to remember how to set up certain things 
usually made with general terms as a placeholder to replace with variables or table names.

Also has useful generic methods that could be used among many different applications for example a function to go from number to the name of the number in a string and vice versa.

Hopefully will turn into a large collection of different useful methods and techniques in all different coding languages.

For the most part I try to keep variable and table names general to avoid having any exact code that is in use anywhere with the exception of general use functions or code.
