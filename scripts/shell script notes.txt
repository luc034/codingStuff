shell script notes

equalities
Command	Description
&&	Logical AND
$0	Argument 0 i.e. the command thatâ€™s used to run the script
$1	First argument (change number to access further arguments)
-eq	Equality check
-ne	Inequality check
-lt	Less Than
-le	Less Than or Equal
-gt	Greater Than
-ge	Greater Than or Equal

Below are some of the most commonly used operators:

-n VAR - True if the length of VAR is greater than zero.
-z VAR - True if the VAR is empty.
STRING1 = STRING2 - True if STRING1 and STRING2 are equal.
STRING1 != STRING2 - True if STRING1 and STRING2 are not equal.
INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2 - True if INTEGER1 and INTEGER2 are equal.
INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2 - True if INTEGER1 is greater than INTEGER2.
INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2 - True if INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2.
INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2 - True if INTEGER1 is equal or greater than INTEGER2.
INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2 - True if INTEGER1 is equal or less than INTEGER2.
-h FILE - True if the FILE exists and is a symbolic link.
-r FILE - True if the FILE exists and is readable.
-w FILE - True if the FILE exists and is writable.
-x FILE - True if the FILE exists and is executable.
-d FILE - True if the FILE exists and is a directory.
-e FILE - True if the FILE exists and is a file, regardless of type (node, directory, socket, etc.).
-f FILE - True if the FILE exists and is a regular file (not a directory or device).

$0 is the scripts name

practice folder
C:\Users\LUC034\New_Folder

cp copy files
cp -r  : is the recursive function to copy subdirectories and files are copied use when copying folders

cp -p  : copys preserving timestamp and ownership

cp -i  : gives prompt before overwriting files


remove files
rm -i will ask before deleting each file. Some people will have rm aliased to do this automatically (type "alias" to check). Consider using rm -I instead, which will only ask once and only if you are trying to delete three or more files.

rm -r will recursively delete a directory and all its contents (normally rm will not delete directories, while rmdir will only delete empty directories).

rm -f will forcibly delete files without asking; this is mostly useful if you have rm aliased to ``rm -i'' but want to delete lots of files without confirming each one.
